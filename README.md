#### train_model.ipynb
This is the code that we use to make and train our model. you can skip this code if you want to use our trained model provided in the `models` folder. However, If you want to train with your own model, a detailed explanation regarding the code is available inside the ipynb file.

#### convert_model.ipynb
This is the same code that was previously used in the class. One difference, however, is that we use RGB images (3 channels) instead of greyscale (1 channel). The respective change is explained inside the file.
